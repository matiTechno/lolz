im developing tcp chat system with opengl rendering (glfw window)
and asio network library.
maybe i should do something better or diffrent to move further but...

also one new thing is that I have one opengl thread and one input thread so
typing feels good and gpu can sleep.

and I'm embedding fonts and images into binary which seems to be nice for such project.
no messing with paths on apple mac.
